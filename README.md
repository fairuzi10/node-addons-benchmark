# Node Addons Benchmark

This repository contains some collections of algorithm implementation in C++ addons for Node JS. The aim of these codes is to measure performance improvement if we use C++ addons instead of pure Javascript.

## Installation
- Go to the desired directory
- Run pure Javascript program with `node program-name.js`
- Install Node addons with `npm i`
- Run the addon program with `node program-name-addon.js`
- Compare the time result

I use Node 8 for this project.
